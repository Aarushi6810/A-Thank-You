                    As the end of the year comes our way, I would like to express how very thankful I am to have you as
                    my
                    teacher. Even though I can't express it through words, you have helped me through every single step
                    of
                    these 4 years, no matter how big or small. All your efforts and hard work to bring out the best in
                    us
                    will never be repaid in words. Instead of just simply being there for us, you have gone through the
                    journey with us as well. I am truly grateful to have been under your hands through almost the entire
                    5
                    years of PYP as you inspired me to never give up. You have pushed me forward and brought out the
                    best
                    not only in my work but also my personality. I want you to know that I will always remember how
                    you’ve
                    guided me through the entire process. You are a fantabulous teacher and an amazing personality who I
                    will always remember. Also, that you are as fine as wine in summertime! “From ABC’s to red, white,
                    and
                    blue; to history and mathematics too, all I want to say is a big THANK you!” Thank you, Miss Ami.
